How should a usability test plan change if you can only test with 10 users instead of 30?,"With fewer participants, you need to prioritize tasks and focus on the most critical paths. You also need to ensure the test includes a diversity of users to cover edge cases. The limited sample size means you rely more on qualitative depth than statistical significance.","Narrow the test scope to high-impact flows, ensure diverse participant profiles, and focus on in-depth qualitative feedback to uncover major usability issues."
What should be included in a UXR report summary slide for a class presentation?,"A UXR report summary should concisely synthesize the most important findings. Start by identifying patterns from interviews, grouping key insights, and translating them into user needs or problems. Add recommended actions or design opportunities.","Include key findings, user pain points, suggested improvements, and supporting quotes. Use visuals to show patterns, and end with clear next steps or recommendations."
How can you structure a settings page in a shipping dashboard for clarity and scalability?,"A good settings page needs clear categorization, progressive disclosure, and scalability for new options. Think about grouping settings logically (e.g., account, billing, notifications) and using a sidebar or tab layout. Consider user frequency and task criticality.","Use a sidebar layout with logical grouping (e.g., General, Shipping Preferences, Payments, Notifications), clear labels, and consistent design patterns to ensure scalability and ease of navigation."
How do you decide if a feature should be manually enabled for select shippers or made default for all?,"Base it on impact, readiness, and risk. Consider metrics: adoption, support load, edge cases. Manually enabling allows phased rollout and learning. If usage is high and friction is low, it can be made default.","Start with manual enablement for testing and iteration. If feedback is positive and no blockers arise, scale by making it default."
How do you ensure long character inputs don't break your form design?,"Consider front-end constraints like max-width, line wrapping, and responsiveness. Use real examples during testing (e.g., long names or emails). Design UI components that gracefully truncate or wrap text.","Allow text wrapping for multi-line fields, truncate with tooltip for single-line fields, and validate inputs with max character warnings to avoid UI breakage."
What are realistic benefits and downsides of building a UX research participant platform?,"Benefits: direct access to participants, reduced recruitment cost, ownership of data. Downsides: maintenance burden, compliance risk, building trust with users. Weigh ROI against tools already in the market.","Benefit: Control and cost savings. Downside: Youâ€™ll need to build trust, ensure GDPR/PH compliance, and handle operational overhead. Only worth it if recruitment is frequent and hard to outsource."
