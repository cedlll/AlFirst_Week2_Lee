1. How to do basic UX research?,"To answer this, I break down the core steps involved in beginner-friendly UX research. Start by defining the objective (e.g., understand pain points). Choose the right method: surveys and interviews are beginner-friendly. Recruit participants based on the product's users. Collect data systematically and analyze by clustering patterns or themes. Finally, summarize insights into actionable findings.","Start with a clear research goal. Use simple methods like user interviews and surveys. Talk to real users, look for patterns in their feedback, and turn those into insights that guide design or product decisions."
2. How do I analyze unmoderated usability test videos efficiently?,"Think about what slows down video analysis: watching full sessions, unclear goals, scattered notes. To be efficient, define what success looks like before reviewing. Use tagging tools to mark issues in real time. Focus only on task completions, drop-offs, and confusion points. Look for repeated user behavior instead of one-off comments.","Define what to look for, tag key moments, ignore filler footage, and focus on patterns. Don’t watch everything end-to-end unless needed."
3. How do I present UX research insights to stakeholders who want business outcomes?,"This requires translating user pain into ROI. First, identify business goals (e.g., retention, conversion). Link each insight to a metric or cost (e.g., “3 users dropped because of confusing checkout → cart abandonment”). Use short, high-impact slides or dashboards. Avoid UX jargon.","Frame insights as problems that block business goals. Link each insight to revenue, time, or user growth impact. Keep your slides short and visual."
4. What’s the right number of users to test a shipping flow prototype?,"The key is diminishing returns. Research (e.g., Nielsen Norman) shows 5–8 users find most usability issues. But edge cases or funnel-based flows (like shipping links) might need broader coverage. Think: do you need diversity in geography, tech literacy, or payment behavior?","Start with 5–8 users for core usability issues. Add more only if you expect differences based on user segment (e.g., B2B vs B2C, urban vs rural)."
5. How do I scope UX work when product requirements change often?,"Dynamic scopes need flexibility. Instead of locking scope, define UX activities around the product’s decision points. For example, plan for quick research sprints before major flows or UI revamps. Maintain a backlog of UX debt and research gaps. Keep outputs modular: one-page findings, Figma snippets.","Scope UX by aligning to product decisions, not fixed features. Use modular research and design deliverables that adapt when plans change."
6. How do I give interns useful UX tasks without overwhelming them?,Break down complexity. Interns usually struggle with ambiguity and scale. Choose self-contained tasks like redesigning one component or analyzing one research session. Add context through examples. Offer regular feedback loops and pair sessions. Prioritize learning over output.,"Assign focused tasks with clear outcomes, give examples, and review often. Let them learn by doing, not by figuring out chaos."
7. How can I merge two logistics products into one without confusing users?,"Users hate abrupt changes. First, map shared features and user journeys. Identify unique elements that need clear communication. Create a unified mental model — one dashboard, one language. Slowly phase out or redirect old flows. Use onboarding cues and flags like “new” or “moved.”","Merge features based on shared use cases. Make the transition gradual, clear, and supportive. Update naming and flows to feel cohesive."
8. How do I know if users understand what a Shipping Link is?,"Awareness is not equal to understanding. Test comprehension directly: ask users what they think the product does based on the landing page or onboarding. Look for misconceptions. Track behavioral proxies (e.g., drop-off before payment). Use A/B tests with clearer phrasing.","Run comprehension tests and track user behavior. If people misinterpret or drop off, your messaging isn’t working."
9. What makes a user-facing dashboard intuitive?,"Good dashboards show key info at a glance, use familiar patterns (tables, filters), and offer quick actions. Intuitiveness is about cognitive load: does the user know what to do next without guessing? Test with real data and real users. Avoid clutter, use hierarchy.","Use visual hierarchy, clear defaults, and test with users. If people pause or guess, it’s not intuitive."
10. How do I handle conflicting feedback from users in interviews?,"Conflicting feedback means users have different contexts. Don’t average it out. Instead, cluster by persona or workflow. Ask “why” they said it — often the reasoning is consistent even if surface feedback isn’t. Prioritize by frequency, impact, and alignment with goals.",Group feedback by user type and reason. Look for the deeper needs behind the conflicting comments. Don’t treat every voice equally — weigh by impact.
11. What’s the best way to track UX debt in a fast-moving team?,UX debt gets lost without structure. Set up a simple Notion board or GitHub label for UX issues. Tag by severity and effort. Review during planning cycles. Encourage designers to log friction early — not wait for redesigns.,"Use a lightweight tracker (like a board or issue tag), review it regularly, and log problems while they’re still fresh. Keep it low overhead."
